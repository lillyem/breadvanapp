# Bread Van App

The **Bread Van App** is a simple Flask MVC project that manages **Drivers** and **Residents**.  
Drivers can be created, scheduled for routes, and have their status/location updated.  
Residents can be created, send stop requests, view their inbox, and track drivers.  

This app uses a **CLI interface** for testing and simulating driverâ€“resident interactions.
